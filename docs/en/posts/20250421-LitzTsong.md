(Start of interview)

Yonah: First of all, thank you very much for agreeing to participate in our interview. This psychiatric hospital oral history project aims to record the true experiences of people who have been hospitalized in psychiatric institutions. So, you are free to speak about whatever you wish without being restricted by our timeline or questions. Before we start, I would like to introduce our colleague, Ventus Uta; she is also an interviewer. Today, I will be leading the interview. Of course, considering our previous relationship, if you feel uncomfortable, you can stop at any time, or you can ask another interviewer to continue the interview. The content of the interview may trigger trauma or unpleasant feelings. Also, this is not counselling or therapy. If you need help, I can recommend crisis intervention hotlines or relevant doctors, therapists, or counsellors. 
 
Litz: It’s fine, if there’s a problem, I just admit myself. 
 
Yonah: The first question for today’s interview, may I ask—what led you to be hospitalized in a psychiatric institution? Could you tell us about your first experience with psychiatric hospitalization? 
 
Litz: It was when I was 14, during the New Year. I think I was quite depressed at that time. In school, the teacher would often ask me to stand up because I wasn’t paying attention in class. So, he made me stand, and while I was standing, I fell asleep. I was depressed to the point where I would sleep during the day. Of course, this could have been an early sign of some kind of mental illness, I don’t remember clearly. But I definitely had this problem with sleepiness, and my mood was quite bad. So, I went to the hospital and asked the psychiatrist what the solution was. The psychiatrist asked me about suicidal tendencies. I said I had strong tendencies and even thought about jumping off a building. The doctor said, ‘I suggest you be hospitalized.’ I said, ‘Okay.’
 
Yonah: So, what was your first experience of psychiatric hospitalization like? 
 
Litz: The paediatric ward was okay. It wasn’t any looser than the adult ward, but families could visit frequently. The environment was a bit better than the adult ward, and there were fewer people. 
 
Yonah: How did the hospitalization feel psychologically, aside from the material conditions of the ward? 
 
Litz: I felt it was okay. It wasn’t particularly bad. It was just like that, right? Personally, I think, can I ask a question? (Sure.) I was really curious about what it would be like inside, so I agreed to be hospitalized. 
 
Yonah: So, what was it like inside? 
 
Litz: It was pretty much like the stereotypical psychiatric hospital. There was an activity room, as I mentioned earlier. There were also separate bedrooms for boys and girls. 
 
Yonah: Was this your first time living away from home? 
 
Litz: Yes, it was my first time living alone outside of home. 
 
Yonah: How did it feel being separated from your family? 
 
Litz: It was okay. I wasn’t that attached to my mother at that time. So, being apart for a while didn’t feel that bad… It was fine. And honestly, I didn’t really feel scared. The adolescent ward didn’t have long‑term patients who were particularly frightening. There wasn’t any obvious abuse by the staff either. If I had to say something… well, I did get tied up once when I caused trouble myself. 
 
Yonah: I’m curious—what was it like being tied up? How did you feel? 
 
Litz: I thought it was okay. I didn’t mind the feeling. Sometimes, I even liked it. If the duration was short, it felt reassuring, like if it lasted just a day or two. 
 
Yonah: Did you have this feeling when you were very young? 
 
Litz: Yes. At that time, I didn’t know it was part of BDSM. I didn’t know back then. I once mentioned on Twitter that when I was little, I tried using a skipping rope to tie my hands. I also saw a PE teacher tie a student’s hands behind his back for being naughty. That left me with a very special feeling. 

## Lockdown Time Without the Sun

Yonah: Let’s talk about something else, as I know you’ve been hospitalized multiple times. What do you think psychiatric hospitals mean to you, or to most people?

Litz: For most people, they are definitely a place of fear. Take the enclosed wards as an example. It was like this. I remember once, during the pandemic, in October 2020. It was pretty terrifying. I was locked in a small dark room for ten days. I had to be quarantined. First, I stayed in the B2 ward for three days. Then the quarantine lasted 14 days, after which I went to the L8 ward. Then I was locked in a small dark room for eleven days. The only light came from the small window, and the room was dimly lit. 
 
Yonah: How did that experience affect you psychologically? 
 
Litz: It was pretty hopeless. Because there was a very old man in the room. His condition was severe, but his family didn’t want to take him out, so it felt like he could die at any moment, connected to a respirator. At night, I could hear the heart monitor occasionally alarming, which was a bit scary. So I felt… (Interviewer repeats the question.) Overall, I didn’t have a particularly negative feeling, but many people who have stayed there would be very negative. Of course, there were three of us in the small room. One was me; one was a young man with schizophrenia, and one was the dying old man. The young man, still in the active stage of his illness, had some catatonic symptoms, so he didn’t seem to experience fear. The old man, of course, was another matter. I was the only one in the room who still seemed somewhat rational. It was uncomfortable, though. Eleven days with no one to talk to. 

## Witnessing Death

Yonah: So, not being able to talk to anyone made you uncomfortable? Was there anything in particular that left a strong impression on you? 
 
Litz: During my stay, two elderly men died in that room. Later, during another hospitalization, two more elderly men died. It happened during the period of Covid and after Covid. 
 
Yonah: Did they die from Covid? 
 
Litz: Partly from Covid complications. Some were in poor health to begin with, and Covid made their immune systems even weaker. Their families refused to take them home for treatment, so they stayed in the hospital. The hospital could only provide basic treatment, like basic antibiotics, and could not get better antibiotics. 
 
Yonah: So, how did witnessing death affect you? 
 
Litz: For example, in the male ward, it was mostly male patients who died. Some old men, just a few days earlier, you could hear them moaning in bed. Then one morning, suddenly, the door to the room was filled with nurses dealing with his body. After seeing it so many times, you just get used to it. I was okay with it. 
 
Yonah: So, the first time you witnessed death was in a psychiatric hospital? 
 
Litz: No, it was my grandfather. That happened when I was around eleven. 
 
Yonah: Do you think that, if these people in psychiatric hospitals had been treated elsewhere, things might have been different? Would their outcomes have been better? 
 
Litz: I think it would have been better, but not necessarily. Maybe it would have just prolonged their suffering. Because many of them were already near the end of their lives. Using antipsychotic drugs affects the lifespan of psychiatric patients and shortens their life expectancy. Many were already in the final stages of physical decline. Overall, if they had been discharged ten years earlier, things might have turned out better. But they had reached a stage where their problems were too serious. Being discharged and treated at that point wouldn’t have much meaning. 

## Lifetime Patient

Yonah: When you say, ‘ten years earlier’, do you mean they had been hospitalized for more than ten years? 
 
Litz: Yes, some were in for twenty, thirty, even forty years. 
 
Yonah: How does that make you feel? Twenty, thirty, or forty years? 
 
Litz: It’s a bit distressing, honestly. You wouldn’t even get a sentence that long for murder, would you? 
 
Yonah: As far as I know, the maximum sentence in China is about 25 years for a death sentence with reprieve. So why would people be confined for 20, 30, or even 40 years? 
 
Litz: Some of them are people that their families don’t want to care for. Others are former state‑owned enterprise employees. The state enterprise benefits are good. They give money to the hospital, so the patients in the enterprise can be admitted at a lower cost. Their families don’t have to pay anything. 
 
Yonah: So, their only reason for staying there is that their families don’t want to deal with them? 
 
Litz: Also, their pension might be higher than the cost of hospitalization. So the pension is higher than the hospital fee, and that’s a problem, right? 
 
Yonah: Indeed. If you were in this system, do you think you would feel differently, or would you be afraid of ending up with such a fate? 
 
Litz: I think I would be fine. I wouldn’t be particularly afraid. If it really was that kind of conclusion, I would just accept it. If my parents had truly rejected me and couldn’t accept my gender identity, well… if that was my fate, like those elderly people in the hospital, being locked up for life, I think I’d just accept it. After all, when I came out, I also prepared myself for the possibility of this. 

## Imagined God
 
Yonah: Could you describe your coming out experience? 

Litz: I was very young. About thirteen. It started with gender dysphoria when secondary sexual characteristics developed. This worsened my schizophrenia symptoms and led me to do some very extreme things in school. For example, I attacked a teacher, then ran home to kill myself. I left a note saying I wanted to become Allah’s sex slave so I could become a girl. Looking back, this was likely a positive symptom of schizophrenia. My second hospitalization was for a suicide attempt. The diagnosis was schizophrenia. Although I was not diagnosed with schizophrenia later, I asked the doctor, and he clearly thought I always had schizophrenia symptoms and that it never fully went away. 
 
Yonah: But is Allah still with you today? 
 
Litz: Yes, like a virtual friend. Sometimes I ask Her questions, and She answers in my head. 
 
Yonah: Does that mean it must be something bad for you, or do you think this is something that needs to be cured or changed? 
 
Litz: I don’t want to increase the dose of antipsychotics. It’s fine, the way it is. She hasn’t caused any significant harm to me, I think. 
 
Yonah: Do you think your virtual friend could be labelled as an error or a disease in the system, and that could lead to involuntary… 
 
Litz: Doctors do think that way, and it could be used as a basis for involuntary hospitalization. That has happened to me before. 
 
Yonah: Do you think there’s a better solution than locking you up, or tying you, or forcing medication or injections? 
 
Litz: You have to look at what the consequences are. Right now, it doesn’t need intervention; I just leave it as it is. But when I was younger, it could have led to serious suicide attempts, so it needed intervention back then. You have to see what the consequences are—whether it threatens your safety or anyone else’s. 
 
Yonah: If someone like you can feel something that others cannot… 
 
Litz: And as long as it doesn’t lead to harm to myself or others, I think there’s no need for it. 
 
Yonah: But under the current system, this would still be controlled, right? 
 
Litz: Yes. 

## The Institution of Abusing Treatment

Yonah: So what are your thoughts on the system? 
 
Litz: Sometimes, there are indeed issues with over‑treatment. Some people’s schizophrenia doesn’t follow typical pathology but has traits of personality disorders. It’s similar to a schizotypal personality. This is part of the schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. Some schizotypal individuals always have a virtual god or friend by their side. But this doesn’t necessarily cause serious issues. However, in China, it would definitely be considered schizophrenia. 
 
Yonah: Have you seen examples of patients being over‑treated? 
 
Litz: I can’t say for sure because I don’t know their full medical histories. Their histories are kept confidential. So I can’t really judge whether someone is being overtreated. 
 
Yonah: You don’t need to give a precise judgment. 
 
Litz: But I think they use MECT too easily on many people. For example, last time, the doctor asked if I wanted to do it. I said okay. The doctor asked how many times, I said six. They said, “Six isn’t enough; you need twelve.” Does that count as over‑treatment? 
 
Yonah: What was the result of doing twelve MECT sessions? 
 
Litz: My mom refused to sign, so I didn’t do it. But I did MECT the second time I was hospitalized. I did eight sessions, and I forgot things that happened over the course of about six months to a year. 
 
Yonah: In the psychiatric hospital, were there any traumatic incidents, or things that seemed really wrong? 
 
Litz: The most upsetting things were the elderly people hanging on by a thread, not knowing how much longer they could last. The nurses also felt bad about it, but there was nothing they could do. Everyone was just doing their job. 
 
Yonah: You mentioned that everyone is just doing their job. So, is it because of the procedures that some people shouldn’t be in there? 
 
Litz: Yes, some patients, the doctors think they could be discharged, but their families refuse to take them out. The doctors can’t just release them, according to the procedures. 
 
Yonah: What are your feelings about this? Or I’ve noticed you seem to have difficulty accepting death, especially the death of others? 
 
Litz: My feelings about it? I’m not sure. Sometimes, being mentally ill and transgender, I feel guilty—like I was some kind of mental health worker in a past life who caused harm to transgender people, and that’s why I ended up as a mentally ill transgender person. It feels like a punishment or karma.  

## Political Prisoners Who Were Forced In 

Yonah: Do you think there are any patients who definitely shouldn’t be kept hospitalized? 

Litz: There are political prisoners. 
 
Yonah: Can you describe these political prisoners? 
 
Litz: One that I met, according to his fellow patients, he had been arrested for holding an anti‑Xi Jinping banner in the street, and then the Shanghai police took and hospitalized him. The authorities paid for it, and they immediately arranged for him to undergo twelve rounds of ECT. According to the nurse, he had been very energetic, constantly calling for human rights, asking to be released. After twelve sessions of ECT, he became very dull, sometimes staring blankly with lifeless eyes. When he was released six months later, he looked happy at that day, and the doctor told him not to do such things again because it wasn’t worth it. 
 
Yonah: So, how many sessions of MECT did he have in total? 
 
Litz: Twelve. 
 
Yonah: So, he was confined for half a year. When did this happen? 
 
Litz: Let me think. He was released in June 2023. This happened during the pandemic. 
 
Yonah: What do you think about psychiatric hospitals being politically used? 
 
Litz: It’s terrible, I think. It’s really bad. 

## Confine and Reform

Yonah: So why can the psychiatric system be politicized? 
 
Litz: Because it inherently has the property of confining people and trying to ‘reform’ them. 
 
Yonah: So, do you think that you should be confined and reformed? 
 
Litz: Sometimes, I think so. 
 
Yonah: Do you think other people in psychiatric hospitals should be confined and reformed? 
 
Litz: Many people shouldn’t be, but that’s the current system. 
 
Yonah: Given we’re familiar with it, do you think I should be confined or reformed? 
 
Litz: If you seriously endanger your own safety, then I think you should be. 
 
Yonah: Why can’t people harm their own safety? Why must people always continue living? 
 
Litz: I’m not really sure. Maybe I just feel, instinctively, that living, when possible, is better.
